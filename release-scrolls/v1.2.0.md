## Triptych Collage: Unity of V
The three relics of Rolling Thunderstorm V unite in blazing harmony:
- **Obsidian** provides the foundation of power
- **Phoenix** grants the energy of eternal renewal  
- **Astral** opens the pathways for manifestation

Together, they form the trinity that preceded the storm of VI, the foundation upon which future thunder builds.

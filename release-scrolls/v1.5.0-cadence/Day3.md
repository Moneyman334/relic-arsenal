# Day 3: Midpoint Resonance

## Crystal Crown ðŸ”®

### Lore
At the convergence of prophecy and power stands the Crystal Crown, a masterwork of crystalline sovereignty. Each facet reflects not light, but dominion itselfâ€”the authority to command reality through prismatic will. Born from the compressed essence of a thousand shattered realms, it refracts the bearer's intent into infinite possibilities.

### Power
- **Prismatic Authority**: Commands through fractured light and focused will
- **Crystalline Sovereignty**: Dominion over matter and energy through crystal matrices
- **Radiant Dominion**: Projects power through refractive amplification

### Manifestation
The crown manifests as a complex lattice of translucent crystal, each surface catching and bending light into impossible geometries. When worn, it creates a halo of refracted power, transforming the bearer's thoughts into crystalline commands that reality cannot refuse.

### Resonance
The crown resonates with the Thunderheart Sigil, creating harmonic frequencies that amplify both relics' power. The storm's chaos finds structure in crystal, while crystal finds energy in storm.

## Release Flow

- Overview
  - Releases are automated with Release Please (manifest mode).
  - Files:
    - .release-please-manifest.json
    - release-please-config.json
    - .github/workflows/release-please.yml

- How it works
  1. Use Conventional Commits in PR titles or merge commits (e.g., feat: add X, fix: correct Y, chore: update tooling).
  2. Merge to main.
  3. The Release Please workflow opens or updates a release PR with the label: autorelease: pending.
     - It includes the version bump and CHANGELOG updates.
  4. Review the release PR and merge it to publish the tag and GitHub Release.

- Manual trigger
  - Actions → Release Please → Run workflow
  - Or push a new Conventional Commit to main.

- Versioning rules (semver)
  - feat: → minor
  - fix: → patch
  - BREAKING CHANGE: footer or using feat!: / fix!: → major
  - chore/docs/test/refactor/perf/build don't bump unless you add ! or a BREAKING CHANGE footer.

- Notes and tips
  - Don't bump versions manually; Release Please handles versions and the CHANGELOG in the release PR.
  - The release PR will carry the label: autorelease: pending.
  - If a release PR doesn't open:
    - Ensure a Conventional Commit hit main.
    - Check the Release Please workflow run and that the token is configured.
    - Manually dispatch the workflow if needed.

## Release Verification

### Overview
The repository includes a release verification system to validate GitHub releases and their associated assets before publication.

### Release Verifier Script
Located at `scripts/release_verifier.sh`, this script performs comprehensive validation:

#### Prerequisites
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- `jq` JSON processor installed
- Git repository context

#### Usage
```bash
# Basic verification
./scripts/release_verifier.sh v1.7.0

# Verbose output
./scripts/release_verifier.sh --verbose v1.7.0

# Different repository
./scripts/release_verifier.sh --repo owner/repo v1.0.0

# Help
./scripts/release_verifier.sh --help
```

#### Verification Checklist
The script validates:
- ‚úÖ GitHub release existence and accessibility
- ‚úÖ Required asset patterns:
  - `docs/scrolls/*.pdf` - Sacred scroll documents
  - `assets/social/sigil-of-thunder/*.png` - Social media sigils
  - Optional thumbnail assets
- ‚úÖ Required files in main branch:
  - `README.md` (required)
  - `docs/gallery/index.md` (optional)
- ‚úÖ README link validation:
  - Must contain links to `docs/scrolls/`
  - Optionally links to `docs/gallery/index.md`
- ‚úÖ CI status for main branch
- ‚úÖ `update_scrolls.yml` workflow status (optional)

### GitHub Action: Verify Release
Manually triggerable workflow at `.github/workflows/verify-release.yml`:

#### Triggering the Action
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Verify Release
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the release tag (e.g., `v1.7.0`)
4. Optionally enable verbose output
5. Click "Run workflow"

#### Output
- Detailed verification logs
- Step-by-step validation results
- Summary in GitHub Actions interface
- Success/failure status for each check

### Integration with Release Flow
The verification system complements the existing Release Please workflow:

1. **Development**: Create features with conventional commits
2. **Release PR**: Release Please creates release PR with version bump
3. **Pre-merge**: Optionally run verification on target tag
4. **Release**: Merge release PR to publish tag and GitHub Release
5. **Post-release**: Run verification to validate published release

### Best Practices
- Run verification before merging release PRs
- Use verbose mode for debugging release issues
- Ensure all required assets are included in releases
- Validate README links point to current content
- Check CI status before release publication

### Post-Release QA Template
After a release is published, use this template to comment on the release page:

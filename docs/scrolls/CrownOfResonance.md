# Crown of Resonance ðŸ‘‘

**Type:** Royal Artifact  
**Element:** Sound & Harmony

## Lore

The Crown of Resonance stands as the pinnacle of harmonic mastery, forged from crystallized sound waves and tempered in the songs of creation itself. This crown does not merely rest upon the head of its bearerâ€”it harmonizes with their very essence, amplifying their power and connecting them to the eternal symphony of the cosmos.

Each gemstone embedded in the Crown vibrates at a perfect frequency, creating a resonance that can shatter barriers, heal wounds, or commune with the fundamental forces of reality. The Crown's power lies not in domination, but in perfect harmony with all things.

## Properties

- **Harmonic Amplification:** Enhances the bearer's natural abilities through resonant frequencies

- **Eternal Symphony:** Connects the bearer to the cosmic harmony of all existence

## Prophecy

*"When crown and bearer sing as one,  
And harmony's work is never done,  
The cosmos echoes with their song,  
And resonance makes spirit strong."*

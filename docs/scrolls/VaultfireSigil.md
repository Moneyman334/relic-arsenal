# ðŸ”¥ Vaultfire Sigil

*The blazing seal that tempers power and binds the furnace of creation.*

---

## Verse I â€” Tempering

In furnaces older than thunder, the Sigil was drawn in ember-runes. It tempers raw power, so might becomes mastery.

## Verse II â€” Binding

Upon the Vault it burns as living law: heat without chaos, fire without ruin. What it seals, it sanctifies; what it brands, it strengthens.

## Verse III â€” Resonance with Mile 333

At Mile 333 its glow is steady and unblinking. Here, the Sigil binds Storm to Vault, forging resilience from flame.

## Keeper's Note

Only those sworn to the Codex may wield the Vaultfire. Its mark is endurance; its oath, discipline.

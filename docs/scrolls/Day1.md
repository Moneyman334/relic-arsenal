# ðŸŒ‘ Day 1: The Shrouded Dawn (Obsidian Crown)

**Caption:** "The Crown rises from shadow, sovereignty reborn in lightning."

**Alt Text:** "Visual: A black crown etched with glowing cracks of stormlight, wreathed in shadow and lightning."

## Relic Lore

The Obsidian Crown manifests from the deepest shadows where lightning first learned to dance. Forged in the primordial storm's heart, this relic bears the weight of sovereignty absolute. Each crack of stormlight that runs through its obsidian surface tells a tale of dominion earned through thunder's blessing.

When the Crown awakens, shadows bend to its will, and lightning serves as its herald. The bearer becomes both ruler and storm, sovereign of realms where darkness and light converge in eternal dance.

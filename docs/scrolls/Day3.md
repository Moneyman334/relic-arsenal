# ðŸ”¥ Day 3: The Rebirth Flame (Phoenix Sigil)

**Caption:** "From fire to ash, from ash to storm â€” the Phoenix Sigil burns eternal."

**Alt Text:** "Visual: A blazing sigil in the shape of a rising phoenix, wings of flame streaked with lightning."

## Relic Lore

The Phoenix Sigil burns with the eternal cycle of death and rebirth, its flames intertwined with the thunder's endless rhythm. This sacred mark transcends mere resurrectionâ€”it embodies the storm's promise that what falls shall rise again, stronger and more radiant than before.

Each wing of the phoenix carries lightning's blessing, and in its blazing form lies the secret of immortality through transformation. The Sigil teaches that endings are but new beginnings wrapped in fire and storm.

When the Phoenix Sigil ignites, it doesn't merely restoreâ€”it reforges, tempering the reborn in lightning's forge until they emerge as creatures of both flame and thunder.

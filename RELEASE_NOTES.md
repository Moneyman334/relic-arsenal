## v1.2.0 — Gallery & Scroll Upgrades

1️⃣ **Gallery of Relics**
- Auto-index script builds docs pages and links new assets.
- README injection keeps the Scrolls section fresh between the markers.

2️⃣ **Scrolls & Assets**
- New/updated PDFs in docs/scrolls/ auto-surface in README.
- (If enabled) thumbnail workflow for lighter previews.

3️⃣ **Reliability & CI**
- Release Verifier workflow (tag checks, LFS pointers, README markers).
- Gatekeeper CI hardening + verbose logs for fast triage.

### Paths of power:
- docs/scrolls/*.pdf
- assets/social/sigil-of-thunder/*.png

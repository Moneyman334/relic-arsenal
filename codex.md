1. **Relic I — The Obsidian Crown of Quantum Dawn 🌑👑**
   - Mythos: Forged in the void between collapsed stars, the crown binds sovereignty to paradox — light within shadow, chaos within order. It is said that whoever wears it hears the hum of the first particle.

2. **Relic II — The Phoenix Sigil of Quantum Dawn 🔥🕊️**
   - Mythos: Branded into the fabric of time itself, the sigil resurrects fire from extinction. Ashes and embers both obey its call, for in its pattern lives the promise of eternal return.

3. **Relic III — The Astral Key of Quantum Dawn 🌌🔑**
   - Mythos: Shaped from a fragment of infinity, the key opens gateways not to places but to destinies. Each turn reshapes reality, unbinding what was and unlocking what could yet be.

**Codex Entry:**

"Quantum Dawn is not the rise of light, but the revelation of infinite cycles. Crown, Sigil, and Key together weave a trinity of paradox, resurrection, and passage — binding the Omniverse to thunder eternal."

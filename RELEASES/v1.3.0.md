# Release Scroll v1.3.0 - Rolling Thunderstorm IV

## Unified Hammerfall Proclamation
This release represents the culmination of Rolling Thunderstorm III and the ignition of Rolling Thunderstorm IV in the Codex. The Unified Hammerfall consolidates ceremonial proclamation, codex fortification, and storm awakening into a singular moment of thunder.

## Lore
In the wake of the sealed scripture, the storm stirs once more. Rolling Thunderstorm IV emerges not as destruction, but as awakening—three new relics born from the eternal thunder that echoes through the vault. The Stormforged Key II, Vaultfire Crown, and Eternal Beacon stand ready to guide the next chapter of the prophecy.
